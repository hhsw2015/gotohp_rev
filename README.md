## CLI Usage

Releases include a standalone CLI executable for command-line usage. Use the `gotohp-cli` artifact for your platform; it does not depend on the GUI runtime.

Releases include a dedicated CLI executable (`gotohp-cli` / `gotohp-cli.exe`):

```shell
gotohp-cli upload /path/to/photos --recursive --threads 5
gotohp-cli upload /path/to/photos --recursive --exclude @eaDir
gotohp-cli creds list
gotohp-cli creds add "androidId=..."
gotohp-cli creds set user@gmail.com
gotohp-cli thumbnail <media-key> --size large
gotohp-cli version
```

## Requires mobile app credentials to work

You only need to do this once.

### Option 1 - ReVanced. No root required

1. Install Google Photos ReVanced on your android device/emulator.
   - Install GmsCore [https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases)
   - Install patched apk [https://github.com/RookieEnough/Morphe-AutoBuilds/releases](https://github.com/RookieEnough/Morphe-AutoBuilds/releases) or patch it yourself
2. Connect the device to your PC via ADB.
3. Open the terminal on your PC and execute

   Windows

   ```cmd
   adb logcat | FINDSTR "auth%2Fphotos.native"
   ```

   Linux/Mac

   ```shell
   adb logcat | grep "auth%2Fphotos.native"
   ```

4. If you are already using ReVanced - remove Google Account from GmsCore.
5. Open Google Photos ReVanced on your device and log into your account.
6. One or more identical GmsCore logs should appear in the terminal.
7. Copy text from `androidId=` to the end of the line from any log.
8. That's it! 🎉

### Option 2 - Official apk. Root required

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

1. Get a rooted android device or an emulator.
2. Connect the device to your PC via ADB.
3. Install [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com)
4. In HTTP Toolkit, select Intercept - `Android Device via ADB`. Filter traffic with

   ```text
   contains(https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photos.native)
   ```

   Or if you have an older version of Google Photos, try

   ```text
   contains(www.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fplus.photos.readwrite)
   ```

5. Open Google Photos app and login with your account.
6. A single request should appear.  
   Copy request body as text.
7. Add that credential string in gotohp.
8. If gotohp asks for a token binding key, keep the rooted device connected and click `Read from ADB`. gotohp will read the account's `lstBindingKeyAlias` from Android AccountManager and save it into the credential.

#### Troubleshooting

- **No Auth Request Intercepted**
  1. Log out of your Google account.
  2. Log in again.
  3. Try `Android App via Frida` interception method in HTTP Toolkit.
- **Token binding key not found**
  1. Make sure the same Google account is present on the connected device.
  2. Make sure root is available to ADB.
